Clearly define a problem or an idea of your choice, where you would need to leverage the Foursquare location data to solve or execute.
Remember that data science problems always target an audience and are meant to help a group of stakeholders solve a problem, so make sure
that you explicitly describe your audience and why they would care about your problem.

The problem would be an excellent location for opening a new Coffee shop in the city of Toronto. The Foursquare data, such as location, 
reviews, tips will be used to determine the best location for Coffee shop, the customers, whether they are satisfied or not by the service
of the current neighbors, what attracts the customers and so on. The choice of location is very important thing, which determine whether 
the business will be successful or not.

Describe the data that you will be using to solve the problem or execute your idea. Remember that you will need to use the Foursquare 
location data to solve the problem or execute your idea. You can absolutely use other datasets in combination with the Foursquare location
data. So make sure that you provide adequate explanation and discussion, with examples, of the data that you will be using, even if it is 
only Foursquare location data.

I will use location data of various data sets including Foursquare data for determining:
1)	The potential customer flows. For instance, in the chosen location should be some business centers, companies, metro stations or 
shopping centers which will provide customerâ€™s demand;
2)	The customer satisfaction. For example, whether customers are satisfied by the current coffee shops by the ratings or tips in the 
Foursquare, by what coffee shops attract people.
3)	Density of the current neighbors in the location. Also you should choose proper area with not huge amount of competitors, because 
there is a chance will come to another coffee shop.
All this information will help me to choose proper location for Coffee shop and determine whether it will be successful or not.
